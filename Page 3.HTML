Although arcades are not as popular as they once were they are still around.<br>
Some may even look the same as they did in the 70s or 80s, holding the nostalgia of that time.

At arcades you win tickets, 
which can be both pysical or on a card depending on what arcade you go to.
When you are done playing the games, 
you can go to the prize booth, use your tickets and claim prizes.
All prizes cost different amounts of tickets, 
some may be 10 tickets while others may be 100 to 1000 or more tickets.
